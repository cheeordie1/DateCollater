1. Open the excel file you want to collate.

2. If it is not .xlsm, export to .xlsm and re-open

3. Developer > Visual Basic

4. File > Import File > DateCollater.bas

5. In the Immediate Window inside the Visual Basic Window, type Collater and click enter
   (This method will give you debug info)
   
   or

   Exit the Visual Basic Window, Click Developer > Macros > Collater > Run

6. Your Test Names are not consistent. I sorted the names in the Debug so you can see where the names
   are inconsistent and fix it. It won't affect the program, though.

7. When there is a table from 1899, it means you have a row with no Date. Fill that in.
